## How it works

This project implements a LFSR where the D-type FFs (DFFs) are replaceded by configurable delay lines.

![ALFSR diagram](alfsr.png)

The configurable delay lines are implement using multiplexers and buffers. The buffers generate a delay line path and the multiplexer select differents paths according to its selection control signals. The selection control signals are generated by a conventional LFSR.

It's expected that this circuit act as either as a convencional LFSR, or as an oscillator, or as a chaotic oscilator, according to the path generated by each delay line.
